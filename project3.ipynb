Feel free to download the scripts or add the code directly to the notebook (please note this code is performed on dataframes).\n",

    "In General, To find the optimal K value there are 2 different strategies. They are : 1) Elbow method which used mean squared distance to find the K value. 2) Silhoutte Score analysis. I considered the silhouette score analysis to find the optimal K value. The value of the silhouette coefﬁcient is between [-1, 1] where a score of 1 denotes the best, meaning that the data points are very compact within the cluster to which it belongs and far away from the other clusters. So, I validated the K value for which we get maximum Silhouette value along with comparing the Other metrics score and considered it as optimal value.\n",
